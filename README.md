## Android Assistant Varvara
Hello! This is simple chatbot project I created based on Skillbox 3 days intense course. Its main capabilities are the following:
* Answering the time and date questions;
* Answering how is it going question;
* Answering the question about life on Mars;
* Answering the question about favorite books. Try it. There's an ester egg there for sci-fi fans;
* Answering the question about video games;
* Anwering the question about the color of the sky;

This my first experimental project in Java. The task of the course was to develop a number of answers you saw above. 
Enjoy and have fun speaking to it.
